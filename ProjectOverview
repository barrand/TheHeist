The Heist

One-sentence pitch
A team-based, role-driven heist game for 3-12 players where most of the fun comes from live collaboration, with light minigames and an optional shared "main screen" that tracks the team's progress.

What it is
This chapter focuses on an illegal heist crew taking different jobs. Players pick specialized roles and log in via web (desktop or mobile). The experience blends D&D-style role-play, escape-room problem solving, and social deduction energy (Among Us), with an in-person, story-driven feel inspired by live Star Trek-style experiences.

Core pillars
- Real player collaboration first (80% social interaction, 20% minigames).
- Role-driven gameplay with distinct responsibilities and tools.
- Shared objective with a clear timeline of critical moments.
- Optional main screen for team progress, timeline, and shared events.

Gameplay loop (high level)
1) Players choose roles and form a team.
2) The game generates a themed objective and timeline.
3) Players complete critical interactions and optional side quests.
4) Team adapts to random events and consequences.
5) Outcome resolves with a success/fail and narrative wrap-up.

Roles (v1 taxonomy)
Mastermind, Hacker, Safe Cracker, Driver, Insider, Grifter, Muscle, Lookout, Fence, Cat Burglar, Cleaner, Pickpocket.

Experience engine (concept)
Input: number of players, selected roles, chosen theme.
Output: a playable "experience skeleton" that includes:
- A heist objective and setting.
- A main timeline with critical interactions.
- Role-specific tasks and collaboration hooks.
- Side quests to fill downtime or prepare for milestones.
- Random events (“monkey wrench” moments) that force adaptation.

Heist theme v1 (example)
Objective: steal the jewels from a museum vault during a black-tie event.
Critical timeline beats: infiltrate the party → steal a security card → open the vault → take the jewels → escape undetected → getaway drive.
Side quests: gas the car, fix a flat tire, procure tools, distract security, scout guard routes, cover evidence.

Player-to-player interaction emphasis
The experience is designed to force real collaboration. Example: the Safe Cracker breaks a tool, the Driver must procure a replacement, and the Insider transports it back. Role dependencies should be frequent and meaningful.

Future roadmap
- Map or room-list generation tied to the experience.
- Campaign mode with paid unlocks and varied themes (space, train robbery, pirate ship).
- AI-enhanced storytelling (LLM chats first, later images, audio, video).
- New specialities and attributes (demolition, languages, super hearing, etc.).
- Separate chapters for other crew types (pirate crew, spaceship team).
