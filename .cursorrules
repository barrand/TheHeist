# Cursor Rules

## Files
- Don't create report/summary markdown files unless asked
- Explain changes in chat, not in new documentation files
- Keep project root clean

## Git
- Commit frequently after meaningful changes
- Write clear, action-oriented commit messages
- Ask if unsure whether to commit

## Code
- Follow existing patterns
- Keep it simple and focused
- Suggest cleanup opportunities as you work
- Use industry best practices (separate view, data, business logic)
