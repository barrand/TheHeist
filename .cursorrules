# Cursor Rules

## Files
- Don't create report/summary markdown files unless asked
- Explain changes in chat, not in new documentation files
- Keep project root clean

## Git
- Commit frequently after meaningful changes
- Write clear, action-oriented commit messages
- Ask if unsure whether to commit

## Code
- Follow existing patterns
- Keep it simple and focused
- Suggest cleanup opportunities as you work
- Use industry best practices (separate view, data, business logic)
- When asked to change something "everywhere" or "all", search the ENTIRE codebase first, then fix every instance in one pass

## Testing & Validation
- Use ReadLints after Flutter edits, fix errors immediately
- After app restart, verify both services respond (curl check frontend:8087 and backend:8000/health)
- Wait 10-15s for Flutter to compile before checking
- Never claim "it's working" without HTTP verification

## Cross-Cutting Changes
When touching both frontend and backend, trace the FULL data flow:
- Check models match on both sides (backend/app/models ↔ frontend/lib/models)
- Verify hardcoded defaults match everywhere (especially initial/starting values)
- Test API endpoints with curl before claiming success
- For 404s: check backend logs for actual URLs requested, verify file/data exists
- For data issues: trace transformations (name → ID → filename), check for stale hardcoded values
