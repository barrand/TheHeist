## Gameplay Mechanics

### NPC Conversation Pressure System
Instead of binary "on-topic / off-topic", model NPC engagement as a **continuum**:

- One axis: **pushiness** (how hard the player is pressing for information)
- Other axis: **relevance** (how on-topic the conversation is)
- The sweet spot is the **middle** — too pushy and the NPC gets defensive/suspicious; too off-topic and you burn turns without gaining intel
- Could surface as a visual meter or purely through NPC dialogue tone shifts
- Makes conversations feel like a real social skill challenge rather than a quiz
