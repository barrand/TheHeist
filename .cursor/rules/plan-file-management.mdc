# Plan File Management

Cursor's plan mode saves files to `~/.cursor/plans/` with no subdirectory control.
After any plan file operation, immediately move the file to the correct location.

## Directories

- **Active**: `~/.cursor/plans/active/` — plans currently in use
- **Archive**: `~/.cursor/plans/archive/` — completed or abandoned plans

## Rules

**After creating a plan** (the `create_plan` tool outputs to `~/.cursor/plans/`):
```bash
mv ~/.cursor/plans/<new_plan_file>.plan.md ~/.cursor/plans/active/
```

**After completing or abandoning a plan**, move it to archive:
```bash
mv ~/.cursor/plans/active/<plan_file>.plan.md ~/.cursor/plans/archive/
```

**When reading or updating a plan**, use the `active/` path:
```
~/.cursor/plans/active/<plan_file>.plan.md
```

**Never leave plan files in the root** `~/.cursor/plans/` — always move immediately after creation.
