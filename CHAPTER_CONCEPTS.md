## Chapter 1: **The Heist** ✅

**Status**: Current Implementation  
**Theme**: Modern crime crew executing elaborate robberies  
**Player Count**: 2-12 players  
**Scenarios**: 11 different heist types

### Overarching Crew Backstory

**"The Reckoning"**

Your crew isn't just pulling random jobs for profit—you're systematically dismantling the **Valdez Corporation**, a corrupt conglomerate that has destroyed lives through illegal arms dealing, human trafficking, and financial fraud. Each member of the crew has been personally wronged by Valdez or witnessed their crimes firsthand.

**The Plan**: Execute a series of strategic heists to gather evidence, funding, and leverage:
- **Early heists** gather incriminating documents and blackmail material
- **Mid-game heists** secure funding for the final operation and recruit allies
- **Late-game heists** eliminate Valdez's protection and resources
- **Final heist** (unlocked after completing 3+ scenarios): Break into Valdez's private vault to retrieve evidence that will bring down the entire organization

Each heist isn't just about the score—it's a step toward justice. The museum might hold financial records. The bank contains offshore account details. The casino is where Valdez launders money. Every job moves you closer to taking them down for good.

## Chapter 2: **Jungle Temple** 💡

**Status**: Future Concept  
**Theme**: Archaeological treasure hunters in exotic locations  
**Player Count**: 2-12 players  
**Scenarios**: 6-8 temple/tomb expeditions

### Overarching Crew Backstory

**"The Reclamation"**

Your expedition team isn't treasure hunting for profit—you're on a mission to **return stolen artifacts to indigenous communities** and stop the systematic looting of cultural heritage by wealthy collectors and colonial institutions.

**The Mission**: Led by an indigenous archaeologist whose ancestral artifacts were stolen by the **Harrington Collection** (a private museum owned by a billionaire collector), your crew has assembled to:

- **Locate artifacts** stolen from communities and held in private collections
- **Document evidence** of illegal excavation and trafficking
- **Return treasures** to their rightful cultural owners
- **Expose the network** of corrupt archaeologists, dealers, and collectors
- **Find the Obsidian Codex**: A legendary artifact that contains the location of dozens of stolen treasures—Harrington's personal acquisition list

Each expedition targets a specific site where Harrington's team has either already looted artifacts or is planning a raid. Your crew races to reach these sites first, document what's there, and either secure artifacts for return or protect sites from destruction.

**The Ultimate Goal**: The final expedition leads to Harrington's private vault, where the Obsidian Codex is kept. With it, you can repatriate hundreds of artifacts and expose the entire trafficking network to international authorities.

## Chapter 3: **Pirate Booty** 💡

**Status**: Future Concept  
**Theme**: Golden Age pirates in the Caribbean  
**Player Count**: 2-12 players  
**Scenarios**: 8-10 nautical adventures

### Overarching Crew Backstory

**"The Free Republic"**

Your pirate crew isn't raiding for personal wealth—you're building **Nassau's Pirate Republic**, a haven for escaped slaves, deserters, and refugees fleeing colonial oppression. Every raid, every treasure recovered, and every merchant ship captured brings you closer to creating a truly free society.

**The Vision**: Led by a former naval officer wrongfully court-martialed for refusing to transport slaves, your crew has claimed Nassau as a base of operations. Your goals:

- **Liberate enslaved people** from merchant ships and plantations
- **Raid colonial supply lines** to weaken European powers' grip on the Caribbean
- **Recover stolen wealth** that was taken from indigenous peoples and enslaved Africans
- **Build infrastructure** for the Republic (ships, defenses, supplies, government)
- **Find Libertalia's Charter**: A legendary document signed by famous pirate captains outlining the laws of a true free state—it legitimizes your Republic and attracts thousands to your cause

**The Enemy**: Governor Reginald Ashcroft, a brutal colonial administrator who has made it his personal mission to destroy the Pirate Republic. Each scenario either directly undermines his power, frees people under his control, or recovers resources for Nassau.

**The Ultimate Goal**: The final scenario involves raiding Ashcroft's personal estate during a colonial gala to recover the Libertalia Charter and incriminating evidence of his atrocities—evidence that will force his recall to England and give the Pirate Republic breathing room to establish itself as a legitimate nation.
