# Minigame Prototype

**⚠️ TEMPORARY/THROWAWAY CODE - For experimentation only**

This folder contains standalone minigame prototypes for testing concepts before integrating into the main game.

## Purpose

- Test minigame mechanics and UI/UX
- Experiment with different game types (lockpicking, hacking, safe cracking, etc.)
- Rapid prototyping without affecting main codebase
- Throwaway code that can be deleted or archived

## Notes

- **Not production code** - Feel free to experiment freely
- No need for tests or documentation
